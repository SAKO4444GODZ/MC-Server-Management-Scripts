# MC-Server-Management-Scripts

A set of OS-agnostic Python scripts to help manage and create Minecraft servers.

ServerWizard:
Automates the creation of a Minecraft server by downloading the appropriate server jar (vanilla, Paper, Forge, or Fabric), setting up configuration files, and creating a user-friendly folder structure. It also prompts the user to accept the EULA.

ModSyncer: 
Keeps mods and plugins up to date by checking against CurseForge, Modrinth, or Spigot and downloading newer versions automatically. Also identifies conflicts between mods and suggests fixes.
